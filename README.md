# Hand-Written-Recognition-using-Multi-class-Logistic-Regression
In this project I have implemented multi-class logistic regression on handwritten dataset. We have used multiple one-vs-all logistic regression models to build a multi-class classifer. Since there are 10 class(0-9), we have trained 10 different logistic regression classifiers. To make code efficient we have implemented vectorized version of logistic regression. 

For our dataset, using one-vs-all classification by training multiple regularized logistic regression classifiers, one for each of the K classes in our dataset. For our dataset value of k=10, training accuracy is around 95%.
